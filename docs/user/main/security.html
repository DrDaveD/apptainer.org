<h2>Security Policy<a class="headerlink" href="#security-policy" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>If you suspect you have found a vulnerability in Apptainer we want
to work with you so that it can be investigated, fixed, and disclosed in
a responsible manner. Please follow the steps in our published <a class="reference external" href="https://apptainer.org/security-policy/">Security
Policy</a>, which begins with
contacting us privately via <a class="reference external" href="mailto:security&#37;&#52;&#48;apptainer&#46;org">security<span>&#64;</span>apptainer<span>&#46;</span>org</a></p>
<p>We disclose vulnerabilities found in Apptainer through public
CVE reports, and notifications on our community channels. We encourage
all users to monitor new releases of Apptainer for security
information. Security patches are applied to the latest open-source
release.</p>
</section>
<section id="background">
<h2>Background<a class="headerlink" href="#background" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Apptainer grew out of the need to implement a container platform
that was suitable for use on shared systems, such as HPC clusters. In
these environments multiple people access a shared resource. User
accounts, groups, and standard file permissions limit their access to
data, devices, and prevent them from disrupting or accessing others’
work.</p>
<p>To provide security in these environments a container needs to run as
the user who starts it on the system. Before the widespread adoption of
Linux user namespaces, only a privileged user could perform the
operations which are needed to run a container. A default Docker
installation uses a root-owned daemon to start containers. Users can
request that the daemon starts a container on their behalf. However,
coordinating a daemon with other schedulers is difficult and, since the
daemon is privileged, users can ask it to carry out actions that they
wouldn’t normally have permission to do.</p>
<p>When a user runs a container with Apptainer, it is started as a
normal process running under the user’s account. Standard file
permissions and other security controls based on user accounts, groups,
and processes apply.</p>
</section>
<section id="setuid-user-namespaces">
<h2>Setuid &amp; User Namespaces<a class="headerlink" href="#setuid-user-namespaces" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Using a setuid binary to run container setup operations used to be
essential to support containers on older Linux distributions, that were
previously common in HPC and enterprise.</p>
<p>Most distributions now have
support for unprivileged user namespaces. This means a normal, unprivileged
user can create a user namespace, in which most operations needed
to run a container can be run.</p>
<p>Apptainer still supports running containers with a setuid starter, but
by default it runs containers without setuid, using user namespaces.
If user namespaces are available when compiling, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--without-suid</span></code>
option is implied.
If user namespaces are not available when compiling, the installer
must choose between <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--with-suid</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--without-suid</span></code>.
Packages are compiled with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--with-suid</span></code> but then the setuid
component is not installed by default and the installer must separately
install the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">apptainer-suid</span></code> package if setuid mode is desired.</p>
<p>In non-suid mode <em>all</em> operations run as the user who starts the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">apptainer</span></code> program.
This has some advantages over suid mode:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Setuid-root programs are notoriously difficult to make fully secure.
Apptainer keeps the setuid portions to a minimum and has passed a
careful review, but still it is a risk.</p></li>
<li><p>Linux kernel developers believe that it is inherently unsafe to
allow unprivileged users to modify an underlying filesystem at will
while kernel code is actively accessing the filesystem
(see <a class="reference external" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/652468/">this article</a>).
Kernel filesystem drivers do not and cannot protect against all kinds
of modifications to that data which it has not itself written, and
that fact could potentially be used to attack the kernel.
By the way it does mounts (details below), Apptainer prevents the
most obvious modifications which would enable elevated privileges,
and there are not currently any publicly known kernel attacks for
this, but this is a significant risk.</p></li>
<li><p>Non-suid apptainer can run nested inside another apptainer command
or in other container runtimes that restrict setuid-root.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are also some disadvantages of the non-suid mode:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Mounting from unprivileged user namespaces makes use of FUSE
filesystems, which run extra processes in user space.
This has lower performance than kernel filesystems, but it is
believed to not be a very significant overhead for most HPC
workflows.
Metadata operations are still moved to the node running the
container, which is a big advantage over having many files directly
on networked filesystems.</p></li>
<li><p>Encryption is not yet supported. Apptainer leverages kernel LUKS2
mounts to run encrypted containers without decrypting their content
to disk.
A FUSE filesystem will hopefully be able to perform this operation
in a future release.</p></li>
<li><p>Apptainer configuration options that restrict the use of containers
are not enforceable, because if unprivileged user namespaces are
available then people could always compile their own copy from source
and set their own configuration options.</p></li>
<li><p>Some sites hold the opinion that vulnerabilities in kernel user
namespace code could have greater impact than vulnerabilities
confined to a single piece of setuid software. Therefore they are
reluctant to enable unprivileged user namespace creation.
See the next section for details about mitigating the impact
of those vulnerabilities through disabling network namespaces.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="disabling-network-namespaces">
<h2>Disabling network namespaces<a class="headerlink" href="#disabling-network-namespaces" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>There have been many Linux kernel exploits that have made use of
unprivileged user namespaces as a point of entry, but almost all of them
in the last few years have been in combination with network namespaces.
Therefore even though the Apptainer project recommends enabling
unprivileged user namespaces, it recommends disabling network namespaces
when possible in order to substantially reduce the risk profile
and need for urgent updates when vulnerabilities are announced.</p>
<p>Network namespaces can be disabled on most Linux-based systems
like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># echo &quot;user.max_net_namespaces = 0&quot; \</span>
     <span class="o">&gt;/</span><span class="n">etc</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">sysctl</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">d</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">90</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">max_net_namespaces</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">conf</span>
<span class="c1"># sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/90-max_net_namespaces.conf</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Apptainer does not by default make use of network namespaces, but it
does have some little-used privileged options beginning with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--net</span></code>
that do.
Those options will not work when network namespaces are disabled.
Unfortunately it is not possible to disable only unprivileged
network namespaces, so this will affect programs that use them
even if run as root.</p>
<p>Some other container runtimes such as Docker and Podman do make use
of network namespaces by default.
Those two runtimes can still work by adding the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--net=host</span></code> option.</p>
<p>Disabling network namespaces also blocks the systemd PrivateNetwork
feature.
To find services that use it, look for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PrivateNetwork=true</span></code>
or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PrivateNetwork=yes</span></code> in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/lib/systemd/system/*.service</span></code>.
This can be turned off for each service through a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/etc/systemd/system/&lt;service&gt;.d/*.conf</span></code> file, for example for
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">systemd-hostnamed</span></code>:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># cd /etc/systemd/system</span>
<span class="c1"># mkdir -p systemd-hostnamed.service.d</span>
<span class="c1"># (echo &quot;[Service]&quot;; echo &quot;PrivateNetwork=no&quot;) \</span>
     <span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="n">systemd</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">hostnamed</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">service</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">d</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">no</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">private</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">network</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">conf</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If the service is enabled (that is, actively used) then restart it
and check its status:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># systemctl status systemd-hostnamed</span>
<span class="c1"># systemctl daemon-reload</span>
<span class="c1"># systemctl restart systemd-hostnamed</span>
<span class="c1"># systemctl status systemd-hostnamed</span>
</pre></div>
</div>

<section id="runtime-user-privilege-model">
<h2>Runtime &amp; User Privilege Model<a class="headerlink" href="#runtime-user-privilege-model" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>While other runtimes have aimed to safely sandbox containers executing
as the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">root</span></code> user, so that they cannot affect the host system,
Apptainer has adopted an alternative security model that protects
against attacks even with the setuid-root mode:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Containers should be run as an unprivileged user.</p></li>
<li><p>The user should never be able to elevate their privileges inside the
container to gain control over the host.</p></li>
<li><p>All permission restrictions on the user outside of a container should
apply inside the container.</p></li>
<li><p>Favor integration over isolation. Allow a user to use host resources
such as GPUs, network filesystems, high speed interconnects easily.
The process ID space, network etc. are not isolated in separate
namespaces by default.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To accomplish this, Apptainer uses a number of Linux kernel
features. The container file system is mounted using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nosuid</span></code>
option, and processes are started with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PR_NO_NEW_PRIVS</span></code> flag set.
This means that even if you run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sudo</span></code> inside your container, you
won’t be able to change to another user, or gain root privileges by
other means.</p>
<p>If you do require the additional isolation of the network, devices, PIDs
etc. provided by other runtimes, Apptainer can make use of
additional namespaces and functionality such as seccomp and cgroups.</p>
</section>
<section id="singularity-image-format-sif">
<h2>Singularity Image Format (SIF)<a class="headerlink" href="#singularity-image-format-sif" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Apptainer uses SIF as its default container format. A SIF container
is a single file, which makes it easy to manage and distribute. Inside
the SIF file, the container filesystem is held in a SquashFS object. When
in suid mount, we mount the container filesystem directly using SquashFS,
otherwise we mount it with squashfuse. In either case, on a
network filesystem this means that reads from the container are
data-only. Metadata operations happen locally, speeding up workloads
with many small files.</p>
<p>Holding the container image in a single file also enables unique security
features. The container filesystem is immutable, and can be signed. The
signature travels in the SIF image itself so that it is always possible
to verify that the image has not been tampered with or corrupted.</p>
<p>We use private PGP keys to create a container signature, and the corresponding
public key in order to verify the container signature. Verification of signed
containers can be done at any time by a user and happens automatically in
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">apptainer</span> <span class="pre">pull</span></code> commands against Library API registries. The prevalence
of PGP key servers, (like <a class="reference external" href="https://keys.openpgp.org/">https://keys.openpgp.org/</a>), make sharing and obtaining
public keys for container verification relatively simple.</p>
<p>A container may be signed once, by a trusted individual who approves its
use. It could also be signed with multiple keys to signify it has passed
each step in a CI/CD QA &amp; Security process. Apptainer can be
configured with an execution control list (ECL), which requires the
presence of one or more valid signatures, to limit execution to approved
containers.</p>
<p>In addition, the root filesystem of a container (stored in the squashFS
partition of SIF) can be encrypted. As a result, everything inside the container
becomes inaccessible without the correct key or passphrase. The content of the
container is private, even if the SIF file is shared in public.</p>
<p>When in suid mode,
encryption and decryption are performed using the Linux kernel’s LUKS2
feature. This is the same technology routinely used for full disk
encryption. The encrypted container is mounted directly through the
kernel. Unlike other container formats, an encrypted container is not
decrypted to disk in order to run it.
Encryption and decryption is not currently supported in non-suid mode.</p>
</section>
<section id="configuration-runtime-options">
<h2>Configuration &amp; Runtime Options<a class="headerlink" href="#configuration-runtime-options" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>System administrators who manage Apptainer can use configuration
files to set security restrictions, grant or revoke a user’s
capabilities, manage resources and authorize containers etc.</p>
<p>For example, the <a class="reference external" href="https://apptainer.org/docs/admin/main/configfiles.html#ecl-toml">ecl.toml</a>
file allows blacklisting and whitelisting of containers.
Configuration files and their parameters are documented for
administrators <a class="reference external" href="https://apptainer.org/docs/admin/main/configfiles.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>These configuration options are only enforcable with suid installations,
because if unprivileged user namespaces are available then users can always
install their own copy of {Package} from source in their home directories.</p>
<p>When running a container as root, Apptainer can apply hardening rules
using cgroups, seccomp, apparmor. See <a class="reference internal" href="security_options.html#security-options"><span class="std std-ref">details of these options
here</span></a>.</p>
