We are happy to announce that [Apptainer version 1.4.0](https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer/releases/tag/v1.4.0) is now available.

This release has many new minor features, changes, and bug fixes.

The most significant changes are support for the libsubid library for cluster-managed subuid/subgid mappings, extended control over the mksquashfs process when building SIF files, and the ability to build for architectures other than the host's architecture.

As always, please report any problems as an [issue on github](https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer/issues).
