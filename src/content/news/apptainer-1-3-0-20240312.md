We are happy to announce that [Apptainer version 1.3.0](https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer/releases/tag/v1.3.0) is now available.

This release has many new features, changes, and bug fixes.

The most significant change is that setuid mode now uses FUSE for filesysem mounts instead of kernel filesystem drivers by default.  This change was made for improved security and for restoration of the ext3 overlay mounting functionality which had previously been disabled because of vulnerabilities.  Another significant change is that underlay mode is no longer used by default for user namespace mode; instead, either kernel or FUSE overlay is used.  The most significant new feature is a new option to share the namespace between multiple apptainer commands in user namespace mode. Please see the above linked release announcement for all the details.

As always, please report any problems as an [issue on github](https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer/issues).
