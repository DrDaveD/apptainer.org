We are pleased and excited to announce the first full release of
Apptainer, version 1.0.0.  As a reminder
[Singularity has joined the Linux Foundation and is now Apptainer](community-announcement-20211130).
This is the first full release after
the rename and has a lot of new features, bug fixes, etc..
Please read the [release notes](https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
and see the 
[admin documentation on migrating from Singularity](https://apptainer.org/docs/admin/1.0/singularity_migration.html)
and the
[user documentation on Singularity compatibility](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/1.0/singularity_compatibility.html).

Please test it in your environment and report problems as an
[issue on github](https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer/issues).
